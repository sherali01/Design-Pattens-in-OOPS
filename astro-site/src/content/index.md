# Java Design Patterns – Complete Guide

This repository contains a **comprehensive explanation and implementation of all 23 classic Design Patterns** using the **Java programming language**.

The goal of this repository is to help you **deeply understand why design patterns exist, when to use them, and how to implement them cleanly in real-world Java applications**.

Each design pattern is covered in **extreme detail**, with:

* Clear conceptual explanations
* Well-structured Java code examples
* Dedicated folders per pattern
* Step-by-step breakdowns for beginners

---

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are **proven, reusable solutions** to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are not libraries or frameworks, but **guidelines and templates** for writing maintainable, flexible, and scalable code.

---

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are broadly classified into **three major categories** based on the type of problem they solve.

---

## 1. Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, helping create objects in a flexible, controlled, and reusable manner.

### Covered Creational Patterns

* **Singleton** – Ensures only one instance of a class exists
* **Factory** – Delegates object creation logic to a factory class
* **Abstract Factory** – Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes
* **Prototype** – Creates new objects by cloning existing ones
* **Builder** – Constructs complex objects step by step

---

## 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns focus on **how classes and objects are composed** to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

### Covered Structural Patterns

* **Adapter** – Converts one interface into another expected by the client
* **Bridge** – Separates abstraction from implementation
* **Composite** – Treats individual objects and object groups uniformly
* **Decorator** – Adds behavior dynamically to objects
* **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
* **Flyweight** – Minimizes memory usage by sharing common object state
* **Proxy** – Controls access to another object

---

## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on **communication and responsibility distribution** between objects.

### Covered Behavioral Patterns

* **Command** – Encapsulates requests as objects
* **Interpreter** – Defines grammar and interprets sentences
* **Mediator** – Centralizes complex communication between objects
* **Memento** – Captures and restores object state
* **Observer** – Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects
* **Iterator** – Provides a way to access elements sequentially
* **Chain of Responsibility** – Passes requests along a chain of handlers

---

## Repository Structure

Each design pattern is placed in its **own dedicated folder**, containing:

* Conceptual explanation
* UML-style reasoning (where applicable)
* Java implementation
* Practical examples

This structure allows you to **learn patterns independently** while also understanding how they fit together in larger systems.

---

## Who This Repository Is For

* Beginners learning **Object-Oriented Design**
* Developers preparing for **interviews**
* Engineers aiming to write **clean, maintainable Java code**
* Anyone wanting a **deep, pattern-by-pattern understanding** of software design

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with **Creational Patterns** (especially Builder method)
2. Move to **Structural Patterns** to understand object composition
3. Finish with **Behavioral Patterns** for communication and flow control

Each pattern builds intuition that helps you understand the next.
